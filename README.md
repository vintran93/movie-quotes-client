## Movie Quotes
The Movie Quotes App was created using JavaScript for the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend. The app allows a user to post a quote from their favorite movies and characters. The user can organize movies and their associated character cards and increment the like button and/or delete a movie or character.
